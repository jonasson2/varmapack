To check that the C functions VarmaSim.c and Testcase.c give the same results as
the Matlab functions varma_sim.m and testcase.m proceed as follows:

From the command prompt, download and unzip the vauto package from github into a
suitable folder, add it to the Matlab path, cd to the varmasim dev folder, and
run matlabcompare:

  $ cd <folder>
  $ curl -L -O https://github.com/jonasson2/vauto-matlab/releases/latest/download/vauto.zip
  [in Matlab:]
  >> addpath <folder>/vauto
  >> cd <varmasim-root>/dev
  >> matlabcompare

This creates the file matlabcompare.txt with details of testcases and results of
simulation with the repeatable Park-Miller RNG, seeded with 42 at the beginning
of each testcase.
