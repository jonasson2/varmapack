Now write me a function in the style of ScalarFromMatlab with signature bool
  CompareWithMatlab(char *filename, char *Bname, double *A, int m, int n,
  double tol). Put it inside FromMatlab.c. It shall find the matrix Bname in
  the file, allocate B with ALLOC(B, m*n), read the matrix, and compare A and B
  with relabsdiff. If all is ok and A and B match return true, otherwise return
  false. Use the ASSERT macro for checks and error detection. Use "set_ Note
  that both ALLOC and ASSERT
