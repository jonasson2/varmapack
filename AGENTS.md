Always obey the rules below.

---------------------------
CORE C STYLE
---------------------------
- Platform agnostic; should compile on ARM and Intel with gcc, clang,
  MSVC (cl.exe) and icx
- Indent 2 spaces
- No blank lines inside functions (allowed between code blocks outside functions)
- Stroustrup braces
- Open brace ({) on same line as function definition
- else on a new line
- // comments.
- Pointer form: int *x. Prefer i++ in loops.
- Max line length 90; no spaces around * or /, spaces around comparison operators
- Use bool/true/false; prefer 0 over NULL and '\0'
- Don't use any casts unless necessary
- Prefer brackets around sizeof argument
- Never use const unless absolutely necessary
- Use "size_t len" for the lengths of the drawn vectors in randompack.c and
    distributions.c.
- Use "int" for all other index and size variables when bounds are known to be small
- Always use int constants for whole number doubles and let C convert them to double

---------------------------
ARCHITECTURE
---------------------------
- Public header: randompack.h
- Single file build (via includes)
- Sources under src/, tests live in tests/, examples in examples/
- Use macros and helpers from randompack_config.h:
-    STRSET, STRSETF, LEN, CLEAR, ALLOC, FREE, min, max
- Do not manually edit r-package/src or python/src; they are synced from src
  via syncR.sh and syncpy.sh
- In tests, use utilities declared/defined in TestUtil.h
- Meson/Ninja drive builds

---------------------------
LATEX WORKFLOW
---------------------------
- Treat .tex and .bib files as editable sources. Treat LaTeX-generated files
  (including PDFs and auxiliary files) as build artefacts; do not edit them.
- Prefer $...$ to \(...\) and $$...$$ to \[...\] for mathematical notation.
- Do not externally edit a source file while its editor buffer has unsaved
  changes. Save first; after an external edit, reload the buffer before editing
  it locally again.
- Use one build command from the document directory. Build when requested or
  when needed to verify a change.
- After any change that affects paper.tex or one of its included figures or
  listings, rebuild paper.pdf and refresh it in Skim without waiting for a
  separate request.
- Refresh editor reference/citation caches after changes to labels or
  bibliography data.

---------------------------
OUTPUT
---------------------------
- Keep responses concise, technical, and style-compliant.
- Do not restate these instructions.
- Provide concrete answers or code following the rules above.
- Stroustrup braces also on function signature lines
- Use 0 instead of NULL
- No unnecessary casts
- Prefer 0, 1, 2, 3 to 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 in double initializations.
